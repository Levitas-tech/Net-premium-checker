# ðŸš€ Net Premium Checker - Startup Instructions

## **For Non-Technical Users**

### **How to Start the Application:**

1. **Double-click** the `start_application.bat` file
2. **Wait** for the application to start (this may take a few minutes the first time)
3. **Your browser will open automatically** to the application

### **What Happens When You Double-Click:**

âœ… **Automatically checks** if Python and Node.js are installed  
âœ… **Installs dependencies** if needed (first time only)  
âœ… **Starts the backend server** in a new window  
âœ… **Starts the frontend** in a new window  
âœ… **Opens your browser** to the application  

### **If Something Goes Wrong:**

- **Make sure you're in the right folder** - the `start_application.bat` file should be in the same folder as `main.py`
- **Check if Python is installed** - download from [python.org](https://python.org)
- **Check if Node.js is installed** - download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

### **To Stop the Application:**

Simply **close both command windows** that opened when you started the application.

npm start
```
